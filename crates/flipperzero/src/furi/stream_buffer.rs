///
/// # Safety
///
/// Stream buffer implementation assumes there is only one task or interrupt that will write to the
/// buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).
/// This behavior has to be carefully ensured when using [`send`](Self::send) and
/// [`receive`](Self::receive) directly.

/// For safer usage, consider the
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "alloc"), doc = "`Sender`")]
